# 11 - Useful Unity UI Shortcuts

The Unity UI has a lot of non-obvious shortcuts and features that everyone should know about - here are five that I use all the time. As an image says a thousand words, and a GIF even more, click on the images to see a GIF as opposed to reading a wordy description. 

### Inspector locking
The inspector can be locked by clicking on the lock symbol, thus allowing the drag-and-drop of multiple objects etc.

### Debug Inspector
By selecting *debug* as inspector state, one can see internal variables.

### Mathematical calculations
Numeric inspector fields support mathematical calculations, very useful for alpha channel (255 * 0.6) and position (10 + 512 * 0.15) etc.

### Expand/collapse GameObject's children
By using ALT + LEFT MOUSE CLICK, one can expand/collapse the GameObject's children all at once.

### EditorOnly tag
Any GameObject marked with the *EditorOnly* tag will be stipped out at build time.
